### Project 1: SAT/ACT Investigation

### Problem Statement

The College Board has created a new more simplified version of the SAT as of 2016 and wants to increase participation across the Country.
    
The team I am working with has been asked to look into a way to increase SAT participation nationwide and in particular look at the model of certain states like Colorado, Rhode Island, and Illinois. These state recently went up to 100% participation and could be a model for other states that have low participation.


### Summary

Things to look into in this report.
- What do the participation rates look like over the years for 2017 - 2019 for the SAT and ACT.
- What do the test scores look like over the years for 2017 - 2019 for the SAT and ACT.
- Do the participation rates and scores have any correlation and what can be learned from that?
- How can this information be used when trying to get a state to increse SAT participation?
- What states might be best to target for incresing participation?

### Data Observations

Important notes found in the Data that help lead to the conclusions.
- Most states tend to have high participation in only one of the two tests.
- Although participation shifts overall mean scores do not shift much per year.
- Higher test participation can lower mean test scores for the state.
- SAT participation has gone up each year while ACT participation has gone down.
- The three states of interest CO, RI, IL all show a sudden increase in SAT participation from 2017 to 2018.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Three states had points of interest to my investigation of the data. Colorado, Rhode Island and Illinois all had low participation in 2017 but near 100% for 2018 and 2019.  The reasons for this seem to involve a change from an already state mandated test, so the funding for State testing was already in place, and changing the way that school assessment testing is done in the state.
    
The SAT is able to offer solutions to these problem for the state by partnering with a state and giving them a way to do assessment testing using the SAT as a replacement for other tests. This also gives students a test that they can use for college admissions and state colleges a way to judge the progress of students across the whole state. That way colleges can tailor admissions to pull in more in state students and raise admissions.

Louisiana could be a good state to target for future SAT expansion.  They have a mandated ACT so the funding is already there.  They use a modified PARCC which other states walked away from and replaced with the SAT.  They are a Common Core state and the new SAT that uses a Common Core background will fit in with their state standards.

### What Next

Things I would like to look into as the project continues:
- Which states have problems with their current assessment tests and could be moved to change?
- Some colleges are droping ACT and SAT requirements, how will this effect state view on testing?
- Other factors that might incentivize states to offer SAT programs like low income areas or low college participation.
- How much does offering college prep options help a student to decide to take the test.
